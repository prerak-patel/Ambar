## FAQ
### Is it open-source?
Yes, almost every Ambar's module is published on GitHub under [Fair Source License 1](https://github.com/RD17/ambar/blob/master/License.txt)

### Is it free?
Yes, Community Edition is forever free. We will NOT charge a penny from you to use it.

### Does it perform OCR? 
Yes, it performs OCR on images (jpg, tiff, bmp, etc) and PDF's. OCR is perfomed by well-known open-source library Tesseract. We tuned it to achieve best perfomance and quality on scanned documents. You can easily find all files on which OCR was perfomed with `tags:ocr` query

### Which languages are supported for OCR?
Supported languages: Eng, Rus, Ita, Deu, Fra, Spa, Pl, Nld.
If you miss your language, please create a new issue and we'll add it ASAP.

### Does it support tagging?
Yes!

### What about searching in PDF?
Yes, it can search through any PDF, even badly encoded or with scans inside. We did our best to make search over any kind of pdf document smooth.

### I miss XXX language analyzer. Can you add it?
Yes, please create an issue on GitHub.

### Are you going to add UI localizations?
As for now there are two options: Russian and English, change `uiLang` in your `config.json`. If you want to add your own localization, please contact us on hello@ambar.cloud. 

### What is the maximum file size it can handle?
It's limited by amount of RAM on your machine, typically 500MB. It's an awesome result, as typical document managment systems offer 30MB maximum file size to be processed.  

### What is the difference between Ambar CE and Ambar EE?
Basically Ambar CE is a downscaled Ambar EE. Check comparison on our [landing page](https://ambar.cloud).

### Can anyone else see my documents?
Nope, check our Privacy Policy.
